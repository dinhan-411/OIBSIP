          <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
          <b>Bruce Lee</b> (November 27, 1940 â€“ July 20, 1973) 
            was a Hong Kong-American martial artist and actor whose career
            spanned Hong Kong and the United States. He was the founder of
            Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing
            from different combat disciplines that is sometimes credited with
            paving the way for modern mixed martial arts (MMA). Lee is
            considered by some commentators and martial artists to be the most
            influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of
            the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. He is
            credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to
            change the way Chinese people were presented in American films.
